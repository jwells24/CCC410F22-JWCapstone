# Mindmap
* The purpose of this mindmap is to outline most of the steps of the process and assign them a difficulty rating. This is the course I will follow over the project.

## XDR vs. EDR

### Research

* The first stage of the project is research, where I want to get as much information as possible about my topic. This research will be used to set up the testing phase of the project as well as support the analysis and conclusion piece in the application section. The research is split into two parts, research for XDR & for EDR. Both are security controls and I will need to understand the same information about them in order to properly compare and contrast.

### Testing

* The next phase of my project is the testing phase. This is where I want to run my own testing and be able to put my own research up against some of the research I found. I want to get a baseline for the recommendations I'm going to make in the analysis portion of the project. I want to run pen testing against both of the security controls, but I'm not exactly sure what I'll be capable of in terms of attacks when the time comes. 

### Application

* The final phase of the project is the application stage of the project, where I want to apply my research and testing to a practical setting. I want to compare and contrast my research findings and testing findings and provide a detailed analysis of my opinions. I also want to relate all of this back to implementing either XDR or EDR in a business setting and relate this to cost and resource consumption.
