# EDR Research

* This page is dedicated to the Design Project 1 milestone of EDR Research. Below are the topics listed that I'm going to try and cover for this phase of research. Works cited can be found at this page: <a href="https://github.com/jwells24/CCC410F22-JWCapstone/blob/main/docs/References.md" target="_blank">Reference Page</a>.


### Identify Products

* In order to eventually build an environment and go through with testing one or more EDRs, we need to find products that we can implement that are free or maybe open source. Below are some products listed that I have identified that would be good for potential testing. Under the product is a description of the product and also a status of where I am in obtaining a version or licensing to use the product. 

1. **SentinelOne**: ActiveEDR is a paid product created by SentinelOne to allow for EDR services and active response for a network. This EDR provides endpoint and network monitoring as well. I wasn't sure how to go about acquiring a version of ActiveEDR for research purposes, so they will not be an option for Design Project 1 but maybe they will be in the future. 
2. **Webroot**: Webroot provides a paid product service for endpoint protection that consists of the standard endpoint monitoring and response protection. Webroot is designed more towards the individual user or smaller companies versus SentinelOne who targets larger organizations for their service. There is a free trial for this endpoint detection service, but I decided not to use up the free trial yet and put Webroot on the backburner for now. 
3. **OpenEDR**: OpenEDR is an open source EDR with a github repo here: <a href="https://github.com/ComodoSecurity/openedr?key5sk1=b9bcf88c4c9ef9bffb11eb0e8ba0d82743de4908" target="_blank">OpenEDR Repo</a>. This EDR is free, so there is no waiting on a company to respond in order to implement it and begin testing. OpenEDR consists of features including: Process/system/network monitoring, registry/low-level monitoring capabilties.  
4. **SNORT**: SNORT describes itself as a packet sniffer and a full blown Intrusion Detection System. There is a free version for SNORT as it is open source but there are alo paid versions that give users access to Cisco Talos verified rulesets. SNORT would be interesting to look at in the future, but for Design Project 1 we are going to leave it alone. 
5. **Wazuh**: Wazuh is another free, open source EDR with a lot of capabilities. It provides cloud services as well, but those are behind a paywall. Wazuh provides a lot of GUI's to use and singular endpoint protection as well. For Design Project 1, I am going to be implementing Wazuh and examining it.
