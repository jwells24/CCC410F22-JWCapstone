### Mission Statement

* The purpose of Design Project 2 is to finish some of what I was not able to accomplish in Design Project 1, that being configuring Wazuh out of the default stage. Once Wazuh is configured to a point where I feel it is not completely default, we can move on to some Pen testing of Wazuh. I want to gain some more knowledge about pen testing against EDR's specifically and then be able to design my own plan to test against my Wazuh environment. I want to be able to roughly design my own pen test plan for Wazuh, which I can refine in the next capstone semester. 

### Objectives:

1. Configure Wazuh - Configure some rules and alerts in Wazuh to simulate a business environment - <a href="https://github.com/jwells24/CCC410F22-JWCapstone/blob/main/docs/configwaz.md" target="_blank">Configuring Wazuh Report</a>

2. Design testing on Wazuh - Research and design a Pen test against my Wazuh environment - <a href="https://github.com/jwells24/CCC410F22-JWCapstone/blob/main/docs/wazuhpenres.md" target="_blank">Pen Test research & Plans</a>

### Reflection

* My main goals for this design project was to configure Wazuh to a point where I think it is ready for my penetration test next semester, and I think I achieved this objective. Another one of my goals was to do some penetration test research as well as start to design my penetration test, which I think I gained substantial progress on. Some objectives that I thought went unmet was in the configuration aspect of Wazuh. I configured everything I thought that would be necessary for me to need to test against it, but there are always more things that can be configured in Wazuh.
