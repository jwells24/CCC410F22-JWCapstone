# Legal Concerns & Implications

* For this project, I will be penetration testing products and there are some legal factors that may affect some of my process. As with any penetration test, there are rules and laws that one must follow. At a core level, ethical hacking in penetration tests are legal as long as you have authorization from whomever you are testing against, are doing the hacking without the goal of monetary gain from systems accessed, and are not maliciously spreading anything outside of the target environment. I will be performing tests against a private environment, one that I have created, meaning I am giving myself full access to attack my systems. However, I need to be carfeul of things such as accidentally spreading something outside of my environment or maybe performing a network scan that performs outside of its jurisdiction.
