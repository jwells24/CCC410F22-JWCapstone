# Design Project 1

### Mission Statement

* My goals for design project one is to get the sense of what is required to create an environment and implement an EDR, as well as do some research regarding EDR's and understand some of the capabilities of an EDR in a real environment. For this project, I will be implementing Wazuh in an environment of three machines and adding two agents to Wazuh. 

### Objectives

1. Acquire some more knowledge about EDR's and find some products available on the internet that provide EDR capabilities. Research documented here > <a href="https://github.com/jwells24/CCC410F22-JWCapstone/blob/main/docs/EDRResearch.md" target="_blank">EDR Research</a>

2. Design and create the environment for Design Project 1 in VMware, as well as implement Wazuh. Environment here > <a href="https://github.com/jwells24/CCC410F22-JWCapstone/blob/main/docs/DesignProject1Env.md" target="_blank">DP1 Environment</a>

3. Create some logs in Wazuh and explore future possibilities for pen-tests, configurations, and future research. Testing here > <a href="https://github.com/jwells24/CCC410F22-JWCapstone/blob/main/docs/DP1Testing.md" target="_blank">DP1 Testing</a>

### Conclusions

* At the end of design project 1, I definitely have a better understanding of implementing an EDR and getting some use out of it. I was able to create an environment and install Wazuh, add two agents to the Wazuh dashboard with the Wazuh agent, and generate some simple events in the Wazuh dashboard. I think I have achieved a good base line of the time and resources it takes to set up a small EDR testing environment, but I want to focus more on testing for the next design project. Now that I have Wazuh installed and an environment, I need to decide whether to focus on Wazuh or maybe another EDR to compare it to. Should I configure both EDR's as best as possible and compare the usefulness of each one? Or should I implement both EDR's and focus on doing some threat testing against them and compare those results? Or should I focus on Wazuh alone and complete an analysis of both usefulness and threat testing? These are the questions I need to answer before designing the second design project.
