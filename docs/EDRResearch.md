# EDR Research

* This page is dedicated to the Design Project 1 milestone of EDR Research. Below are the topics listed that I'm going to try and cover for this phase of research. Works cited can be found at this page: <a href="https://github.com/jwells24/CCC410F22-JWCapstone/blob/main/docs/References.md" target="_blank">Reference Page</a>.


### Identify Products

* In order to eventually build an environment and go through with testing one or more EDRs, we need to find products that we can implement that are free or maybe open source. Below are some products listed that I have identified that would be good for potential testing. Under the product is a description of the product and also a status of where I am in obtaining a version or licensing to use the product. 

1. **SentinelOne**: 
2. **Webroot**: 
3. **OpenEDR**: OpenEDR is an open source EDR with a github repo here: <a href="https://github.com/ComodoSecurity/openedr?key5sk1=b9bcf88c4c9ef9bffb11eb0e8ba0d82743de4908" target="_blank">OpenEDR Repo</a>. This EDR is free, so there is no waiting on a company to respond in order to implement it and begin testing. OpenEDR consists of features including: Process/system/network monitoring, registry/low-level monitoring capabilties.  
4. **SNORT**:
5. **Wazuh**:
