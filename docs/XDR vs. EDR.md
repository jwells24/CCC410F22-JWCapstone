# XDR vs. EDR
* XDR (Extended Detection Response) & EDR (Endpoint Detection Response) are two professional standards of security solutions that are available to 
businesses and security providers today. They both offer the same goal of protection of a network and the devices of the network, but have different approaches as 
well as their own advantages and disadvantages. 

## Why XDR or EDR?
* Both of these techniques are currently advertised as the best of the best for enterprise cybersecurity solutions. I gained experience with implementations of EDR & XDR 
through platforms such as Webroot and SentinelOne and it is apparent the usefulness of both of these solutions. However, such as a business must decide between two marketing
strategies, it must all decide between the two security strategies to determine the best one for the job. It would be important to highlight the advantages and disadvantages
for specific business and network models for both of these methods, and it would be very relevant to the current cybersecurity scene. 

## My Approach
My final goal for this research project is to create a baseline for businesses or security providers to compare and contrast the two approaches and decide
which is best for them. Therefore, I have to achieve: 
1. **Research of both XDR & EDR in a private environment**
2. **Extensive cost and implementation analysis of XDR vs. EDR** 
3. **Extensive analysis and research of existing implementations and events regarding both XDR & EDR.**

The steps listed above are listed in the chronological order in which they would take place, with research taking place first. In the research phase of the project 
I would focus on testing responses to different attacks, also using some knowledge gained in from the Ethical hacking & pentesting class. Testing response time and defense
success to different attacks would be the main priority of the research aspect. As for the cost analysis portion, I want this research and capstone to be usable by a 
business and all decisions eventually come down to cost and cost efficiency. It would be important for me to adequately cover the costs related to outsourcing both of
these methods or even creating an in-house version of XDR or EDR. Lastly, I want to look at some real enterprise environment data and events of XDR & EDR in action. Since 
I can't provide large scale data of these methods in action, finding them out on the internet would be helpful as providing some more larger data sets to support my research
or provide new insight.
<br>
In conclusion, I want to provide an informative and well-researched comparison between XDR & EDR for use in a business environment. The three steps above would help me 
achieve this, but there would be other smaller steps included with this.
