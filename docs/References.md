|    | This article will be a good reference for cost analysis, and questions related to implementation costs. This article covers insurance but includes information about various security controls such as EDR.   |

|    | This will be a baseline of information about XDR.                                                                                                                                                             |

|    | MDR is not directly my focus, but it involves XDR & EDR heavily and I think more information about implementation and use of the two can be found here.                                                       |

|    | This publishment gives real world information and examples about EDR being created, managed, and implemented in a real environment.
