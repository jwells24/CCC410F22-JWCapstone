| Wazuh                   | Wazuh is the EDR I will be using to conduct a pen test against. It is necessary for the project, but is open-source and free.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Free           | Myself        | SPR22 Sprints 1 & 2 |
| Systems for Pen testing | The actual pen-test environment I will be using to configure Wazuh and conduct the pen test in. The cost is not going to be high, since I will be using my own systems which are capable of handling the virtual environments necessary for the pen test. The only costs I could see here is if something breaks in my system, I may have to replace it or power costs.  These costs will be low, if any at all, and I will be able to pay for them.  | Less than $100 | Myself        | SPR22 Springs 1 & 2 |
| Pen Test software       | The software I will be using to conduct the pen test. I am not sure which software I will be using for the actual pen test, but there are enough open source tools and  resources that I can use where money will not be an issue for this dependency.                                                                                                                                                                                                | Free           | Myself        | SPR22 Sprint 2      |
