|     | This article will be a good reference for cost analysis, and questions related to implementation costs. This article covers insurance but includes information about various security controls such as EDR.                       |

|     | This will be a baseline of information about XDR.                                                                                                                                                                                 |

|     | MDR is not directly my focus, but it involves XDR & EDR heavily and I think more information about implementation and use of the two can be found here.                                                                           |

|     | This github blog post will give me a few methods and techniques on bypassing EDRs. This source will also provide me more knowledge about pen testing EDRs.                                                                        |

|     | This source will give me more information about creating my pen test plan, as well as some methods to follow for the actual pen test.
