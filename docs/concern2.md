# Ethical Concerns & Implications

* I wanted to focus on some ethical concerns because I touched on it slightly in my first concerns document, so I wanted to dive a little deeper into it. As I previously stated, in the second half of capstone I want to do some penetration testing in my own environment and test some of the facets of Wazuh. For this to work, I will be trying to hack and break certain parts of Wazuh in a private environment. This has some ethical implications because I am not employed by Wazuh, and it is not necessarily sanctioned by Wazuh to try to break their product. In addition to this, if I manage to find some vulnerabilites or workarounds to exploit Wazuh and I publish these publicly, then maybe someone with malicious intent will use my work to cause harm to an organization that is using Wazuh. These are possible ethical concerns that I have, but there are ways to remedy these concerns. 

### Mitigation

* One of the main ethical conerns I have is that Wazuh isn't giving me explicit permission to exploit their product in a private environment, but I am doing so for educational purposes. I'm not exploiting Wazuh in a real world environment and I am not profiting anything from this either. My second ethical concern was that someone might be able to use my work as a basis for exploiting Wazuh. I think that the easiest way to remedy this is to not make my work published on github public. The work I do will be viewed only by my professors as well as some students, and it is unlikely that anyone will gain access to my work and be able to apply it to a real world, malicious scenario. 

### Sources

* The first source I chose by the Panmore Institute is an article that goes over the ethical code of ethical hacking and other important aspects of ethics. An important quote I found in the article that applies to my project is "As an outsider, the ethical hacker could intentionally or unintentionally disclose the companyâ€™s confidential information to other parties." As an outsider exploiting Wazuh, it would be ethically wrong of me to disclose any knowledge I gain that could potentially negatively impact Wazuh, and it is important to me that I maintain this. This first source will provide to me a guide to ethics I need to follow for my ethical hacking project. The second source I chose is by GeeksforGeeks and covers more of the advantages/disadvantages of ethical hacking. This source will be useful to me to provide information about what could potentially happen if I make the wrong move ethicallly, and will provide a second baseline to follow for the ethics of ethical hacking.
