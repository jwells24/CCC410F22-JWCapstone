# Abstract, Problem, Purpose

### Abstract

* One of the most important parts of a modern organizations computer security is the existence of network and system monitoring systems such as EDRs. Finding the most applicable, affordable, and useful EDR for your environment can be the key to a companies security perfection. This capstone project will focus on examining what makes an EDR useful and will contain a deep dive and ethical hacking aspect into the popular open-source EDR Wazuh. 

### Problem/Research Statement

* There are many EDR's on the market today, and navigating this environment can be hard and confusing for companies looking to identify the correct product for them. Understanding how an EDR can be affective, the different advantages/disadvantages it brings to the table, and how they compare to others can be a crucial piece of information. Being able to provide a baseline of how to evaluate these products, as well as creating a broader, in-depth understanding of an EDR product as an example will serve as good insight into the EDR market. 

### Purpose Statement

* The purpose of my capstone project is to use my knowledge of ethical hacking and cybersecurity and deeply examine a free, baseline example of an EDR which is Wazuh. With this analysis and review of Wazuh, I hope to provide a deeper insight into the evaluation of EDRs specifically to create a baseline to be used by companies when they are looking for EDRs to improve their organization security.

* My goal is to provide a baseline for EDR analysis, in both technical terms and cost-analysis terms, that will be useful to organizations for Wazuh and can also be applied to other EDR products to be used in comparison to each other. I want to focus specifically on completing an ethical hacking analysis of Wazuh and creating a detailed review and cost-analysis of Wazuh for professional use.
