# IPv6
* I have always been interested in IPv6 & the eventual implementation to this new and improved form of addressing. IPv6 is a new and improved form of IPv4,
but my focus wouldn't necessarily be on the network aspect of the protocol but rather the security aspects of IPv6. 

# Why IPv6?
* Eventually, the world is going to switch to IPv6 as a whole and a new protocol for computer addressing on every device is going to have some complicated security
implications. Malicious threat actors are going to be all over IPv6 trying to find a new way to exploit this protocol, and it is going to be a hot topic for security
research in the coming years. Therefore, I think it is a very important and relevant topic to look at for my capstone. 

# My Approach
I don't want to just examine IPv6 as a protocol because I don't think that would be relevant or interesting as a capstone project. My main goal for my approach would
be to analyze IPv6 from a security standpoint and provide a threat analysis of specific aspects of the protocol. Below are the steps for project:
1. **Security research in a private environement involving IPv6**
2. **Examine real world attacks and breaches involving IPv6**
3. **Provide a thorough security analysis of my findings**

My first step, I would think, would involve penetration testing involving the IPv6 protocol. Like I said, I'm not sure how this would look exactly or if it is feasible 
because I haven't finished the ethical hacking course yet, which is why this is my second option. My focus on the first step would be to look at existing vulnerabilities
regarding IPv6 and even try to find my own. The second stage of my project would be to conduct extensive research on IPv6 vulnerabilities detailed in real breaches as well
as other implementations of IPv6 in the real world to compare and contrast with my findings. The final step would be to not just provide a research paper, but to provide
an extensive security analysis of the protocol and really focus on documentation in a professional manner.
